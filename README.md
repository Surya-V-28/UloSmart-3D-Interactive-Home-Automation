## ‚ú® Features
- **Virtual Home Interaction**: Navigate through a 3D rendition of your home and control devices like lighting, thermostats, security cameras, and more.

- **Real-Time Smart Home Control**: Seamlessly adjust your actual home‚Äôs smart features through the virtual interface.

- **Built-In Assistant**: Get real-time alerts for potential hazards such as gas leaks, fires, and unauthorized access, ensuring your home stays safe and secure.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Technology Stack
### Software
- The **Interactive 3D Virtual Home** was developed using **Unity3D**.
- The **3D objects and other assets** used to built the 3D Virtual Home were created using **Blender**.
- **Firebase** was used as the **database** and Single Source of truth for the **state of the different Electronic Components.**
- The **User Interface** and **Arduino Board** was programmed using C# and C++ respectively.

### Hardware
- An **Arduino Uno Board** to control the appliances
- A **NodeMCU Board** which acts as a bridge between the software and hardware. It directs the Arduino UNO Board to control the appliances by listening to the app.
- **Relay Switches** to switch on/off the appliances electrically and protect the system from too high voltage or current.
- **Gas Sensor** to detect smoke and trigger sound.
